# Object_Tracking_using_YOLO_model

The ***main.py ***script serves as the core functionality for video object detection and tracking. It performs the following tasks:

**Video Capture:** The script initiates video capture using an appropriate library (e.g., OpenCV). This establishes a stream of frames from the video source.

**Object Detection with YOLO:** Each captured video frame is processed using a pre-trained YOLO model. This model identifies and locates objects of interest within the frame.

**Object Tracking:** Once objects are detected, the script implements a tracking algorithm to follow their movement across subsequent frames. This allows for continuous monitoring of the objects throughout the video.

**Video Saving:** The script include functionality to save the processed video with the detected and tracked objects highlighted or labeled. This facilitates further analysis or visualization of the results.
